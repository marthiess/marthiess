## Salut, Hi, Hola 👋🏽

I'm Martha, a [technical writer and aspiring documentation engineer](https://marthaobike.vercel.app/). I'm a storyteller before anything else; with 5+ years in content marketing, I'm now marketing in a different language: writing for more technical audiences.

I care about clear, human documentation, especially for developer tools and products, and I love turning messy, complex ideas into content that people actually want to read.
